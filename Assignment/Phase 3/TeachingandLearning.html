                        born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the 
                        great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids 
                        pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally 
                        encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to 
                        obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can 
                        procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise,

                        that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure? On the other hand, we 
                        denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the 
                        moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame 
                        belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil 
                        and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and 
                        when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in
