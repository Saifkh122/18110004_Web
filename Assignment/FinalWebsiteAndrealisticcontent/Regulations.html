                    <h2>Health and Safety Systems</h2>
                    <p>
                        All schools have a duty to comply with the legal requirements outlined in the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 and its associated regulations. Education employers have duties to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the health, safety and welfare of teachers, education staff, pupils – both in school and during off-site visits – visitors, volunteers and contractors. 

The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) is the national watchdog and regulator for work-related health, safety and illness. They acknowledge that health and safety can be unnecessarily bureaucratic and they are seeking to restore a simpler and more proportionate approach to health and safety regulation – visit their web site Health and safety made simple (HSE) to see how you can simply cover the minimum essential requirements for health and safety documentation and practice.

                    <h2>Food Safety</h2>
                    <p>
                            These pages are to assist schools to manage the food safety requirements relating to
the range of activities involving food that are operated and managed by schools
themselves, not those activities that are contracted out to another food business (eg.
Eden Foods for lunchtime meals).
Activities involving food for which the school has responsibility may include: breakfast
or after school clubs, cooking clubs, tuck shops, cake sales, parties/discos, and
events such fetes, barbeques, quiz nights etc.
In addition, schools may let their kitchen facilities to members of the school, the PTA,
those operating on the school’s behalf or wider community. Legally, schools retain
responsibility for ensuring that food hygiene standards are met in these situations.

                    <h2>Safe Learning Enviroment</h2>
                    <p>
                            School is not always a safe place for a refugee child; quite often, it is at
school that he or she is abused or exploited. The nature of violence
inflicted on children in learning environments can be emotional, physical
and psychological, and range from the subtle to the very explicit. All too
frequently it is sexual and gender-based.1

Without adequate monitoring, reporting and referral mechanisms,
children in schools often face severe corporal punishment, peer-to-peer
violence and sexual harassment or exploitation. The perpetrators could
include teachers, other authority figures and the staff of international
organizations and non-government organizations. The risk of exploitation
and abuse is higher at the upper-primary and secondary levels, when
children reach adolescence. Girls are especially vulnerable at this stage,
and may be forced to engage in so-called survival sex2
 to cover school
costs and stay on good terms with their teachers.
Schools and teachers are highly influential in a child’s life, and have a
lasting impact on attitudes and behaviour. As such, unsafe learning
environments contribute to the perpetuation of violence within
communities.
