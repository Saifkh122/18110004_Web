                                <li><p>The Debate Team:Students on the debate team are more likely to be engaged in the issues of today, able to think critically on their feet and are not afraid to speak out - all qualities that colleges look for in prospective students. Also, students that participate on debate teams are often outspoken within class, leading classmates into thoughtful discussions.</p></li>
                                <li><p>Volunteer Work and Community Service: Most colleges consider some form of volunteer work or community service a must-have for all applicants. The best way to gain volunteer experience is to consider the activities you enjoy and find a way to apply them into your service hours.

For example, if you enjoy art, volunteer at a local children's center to help kids with their creative processes. If you love to play music, volunteer to play at a local senior center.

Are you a sports fanatic? Coach your local little league team. An animal lover? Shelters are always in need of great volunteers.

There are so many easy ways to apply whatever you love to helping out in your community - just think creatively!</p></li>
                                <li><p>Athletics: Participating in sports is a great way to showcase your teamwork, leadership skills and that you place an emphasis on athletics and physical fitness. While athletics are a platform to demonstrate these important traits, it is common for students to participate in them and may not hold as much significance as when balanced with other activities.

As with anything in life, balance is very important to keep in mind. It's ideal to try to choose activities from different categories, both social and academic, so that colleges are able to see your wide range of talents and strong character traits. </p></li>
