                    <h2>Assesment for Learning</h2>
                    <p>
                        Effective assessment of children in Jordan involves noticing, recognising and responding to their learning. Assessment informs teaching so you can plan for a                               child’s next steps and support them to achieve these. Assessment actively involves children and their families in decisions about their learning.

                    <h2>Transtioning Children with Learning support needs into school</h2>
                    <p>
                            Early planning, parent engagement and strong relationships between the school, early learning service, parents and the Ministry are critical to a child                             with learning support needs making a successful and positive transition from the Jordan service to school.
                            <h3>Plan the transition to school</h3>
Planning should begin 6-12 months before the child is to start school (or earlier if changes to property such as fences, toilets or steps are needed). An agreed timeline is critical so everyone knows what to expect. Decisions about the type, number and length of school visits need to be made jointly and may vary from situation to situation.

Planning for the transition should include the parents, the school, the early learning service, Ministry of Education staff and others, where appropriate, for example early intervention (EI) providers and cultural supports. Cultural supports, or other advisers and interpreters, may need to be organised well in advance.

Strong relationships based on open communication between the early learning service and the school are at the heart of achieving effective transitions. For example, the child’s teacher might want to visit the Jordan service to see the child in their current settings. Planning should aim to provide continuity of learning across both settings. For instance, successful learning plans and strategies are shared.

Clear and shared understanding about resourcing, such as specialist support and para-professional help, is required to ensure they are used effectively.

                            <h3>Staggered transition to school</h3>
                            As a result of changes to the Education Act 1989, for those children aged 4 and 5 who would benefit from a staggered transition to school, a transition plan needs to be agreed between the child’s parents, the school principal and the Ministry of Education.

Once a child has started school (any time before the age of 6) if issues emerge that full time attendance is difficult then a transition plan may be put in place.

Once a transition plan is in place, the child will then be required to attend school in accordance with that plan. Schools are to use the ‘J’ (justified absence) attendance code in their Electronic Attendance Register to record absences that align with the transition plan.

A template has been developed to support the process of agreeing a transition plan. We note there is no requirement to use this template, a simple email trail showing the parents, principal and Ministry of Education have agreed to the plan is sufficient to meet the legislative requirements.

                    <h2>Supporting Children in Care</h2>
                    <p>
                            A guide for educators working with children from early childhood to secondary school age.

Children and young people in care, or who have been in care, are likely to have had traumatic early experiences. They may need more support with getting along with others, participating and learning alongside their peers.

The Supporting children in care guide is for educators in all settings so that they can provide appropriate support for children and young people, so they experience wellbeing and achievement.
