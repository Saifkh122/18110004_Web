                    <h2>Emergencies and Traumatic Incidents</h2>
                    <p>
                        Building trauma-sensitive schools involves changes to school policy, practice, and culture and
requires ongoing efforts to ensure that all students—including students affected by trauma—are
experiencing social, emotional, and educational success. As school and district leaders, you
play a crucial role in bringing about change. Developing and sharing a vision of trauma
sensitivity and the process for achieving it will help to overcome challenges by charting a course
of action and maintaining focus and commitment among participants.
This action guide is intended to be used in conjunction with and after viewing the Leading
Trauma-Sensitive Schools online module, to provide school leadership with a roadmap and
tools for implementing a trauma-sensitive approach schoolwide, including recommendations for
using various components of the Trauma-Sensitive Schools Training Package. This guide
introduces a multi-phased process for adopting a trauma-sensitive approach (see Figure 1).
Each phase includes key objectives, activities, resources, and an action planning template. By
using the tools and resources provided, your school will develop and implement custom plans
for adopting a trauma-sensitive approach schoolwide.

                    <h2>Counseling</h2>
                    <p>
                            School counseling takes place in public and private school settings in grades K-12. Counseling is designed to facilitate student achievement, improve student behavior and attendance, and help students develop socially. Mental health professionals with master’s degrees or beyond, school counselors both provide counseling and serve an educational role in and around schools. Many schools have full-time counselors on staff in order to support students who are experiencing personal or academic challenges, help students choose careers and plan for college, and intervene when students face behavioral, physical, or mental health challenges.

                    <h2>Students and Parents Feedback</h2>
                    <p>
                            Effective teaching helps to improve students’ learning and prepares them for a successful future. But to deliver great teaching, schools need to get feedback from students and parents on their teachers and the learning environments they provide. A quality student feedback can help districts, schools, and educators garner valuable feedback and insights that they can leverage to improve their teaching quality.
